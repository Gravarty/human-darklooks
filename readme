### **This theme is a dark variant of luigifab’s human-theme, which itself is based on an official Ubuntu 10.10 theme called “Darklooks”.**

The theme works with GTK 2.24 (with murrine), GTK 3.24, and GTK 4.12–4.19. It works with or without a compositor, with or without CSD windows, and with or without gtk3/4-classic.

It is mainly intended for the MATE desktop environment. It’s not further tweaked to work with Xfce or Cinnamon, where it will still show the original orangish/brownish colors.
